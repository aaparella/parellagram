Go app to build and host personal website. Builds landing page and individual blog post pages from contents of /posts directory, links all stylesheets found in /styles. Built using all standard library functionality, no external dependencies.

Builds pages once on startup, and serves out of Artifacts directory specified in config.ini. For the time being you need to create all directories you specify in config manually before startup, so that I don't overwrite something on accident that you did not intend.
